/**
 * Every word the salon owner reads, in one place.
 *
 * RULE: plain language only. Our users run salons, not software — they should
 * never have to decode industry jargon. Before adding a string here, say it out
 * loud to someone who has never used a booking system.
 *
 *   no-show      -> didn't come
 *   utilisation  -> how busy
 *   buffer       -> cleanup time
 *   availability -> free times
 *   revenue      -> money earned
 *   provider     -> comes from ctx.labels (Stylist / Doctor / Trainer ...)
 *
 * Domain nouns (stylist/service/client) come from the vertical config
 * (ctx.labels) and are NOT duplicated here — see 01-domain-model.md §4.
 * This file is UI chrome only. Translations later swap this one file.
